# Contributing to Transcriptase

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed flow, please update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Don't forget to test with ```npm i -g ./```
6. Make sure your code lints.
7. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/eksant/global-express/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/eksant/global-express/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D); it's that easy!

## We are interested in development ideas
Do not hesitate to convey your idea no matter how small. Report a features by [opening a new feature](https://github.com/eksant/global-express/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURES%5D+).

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We like the neatness of coding and using prettier in vscode with configure:
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* print width 120 characters
* single quote

## Become an active contributor
We will display your github account as a contribution to the family **Global Express** as our gratitude.
